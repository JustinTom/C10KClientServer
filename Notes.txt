Notes

epollSelectServer (Listen backlog queue size at 10,000)
	- Able to sustain up to 30,000 connections spread out over 3 clients (10,000 connetions each)
	- As soon as we connected our 4th client with another 10,000 connections, the server broke at exactly 30,004 concurrent connections
		- Error was at line 43: data = receiveSock.recv(bufferSize) "socket.error: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer"
	- Data being sent over was "Hi", "Howdy", "Hello"
